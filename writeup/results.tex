We ran simulations of both types of naming games, varying the similarity metric and the number of species.
Each naming game simulation was populated with 15 fireflies of each species and ran for 1000 time steps. 
For simplicity, we set the pattern length to 10 -- that is, we defined the flash patterns as a sequence of ten 0s or 1s, with a 1 indicating a flash and a 0 indicating no flash for one time unit. 
Because we view the patterns cyclically, there is no inherent starting index with which to present the signals. 
Consequentially, we chose to display the resulting patterns of the naming game as ending with the longest contiguous sequence of 0s, emulating the ``waiting" time observed in firefly signals.
