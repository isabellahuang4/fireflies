Upon visual inspection of the flash patterns, those patterns emerging from the partial sequence naming game seem to exhibit pseudo-periodic properties. 
Given that observed firefly flash signals are periodic in nature, that is, they can be fully described by the flash duration (length of a contiguous "on"), interpulse interval, and flash pattern interval, we proffer that periodic sequences are efficient solutions to the problem of distinguishability.
Moreover, the simulation selection pressures of interrupted signals as seen in the partial sequence naming game pose a better imitation of the selection pressures 
 
% periodic sequences are efficient solution to the problem???
